# landing-page

This is a simple landing page for a fictional community management bot (and it's already responsive!). I watched Rafaella Ballerini's tutorial so I could learn and apply some CSS concepts. Her video is avaliable [here](https://youtu.be/llF6vD-RljE).

## Layout web

## Layout mobile

This layout works as well as the web version, but it doesn't have the hamburger menu for now.
